## How to Run it

You will need a Kinect (any version, but I recommend the first one) with properly drivers installed to recognize Kinect in your system. Also, need [Processing](https://processing.org/download/) instaled to run.

Open the project in the Processing editor and press "Run".

Libraries used:
* [Minin](http://code.compartmental.net/minim/)
* [Open Kinect for Processing](https://shiffman.net/p5/kinect/)
* [Video](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/video/index.html)


## Context of the Work of Art

"Universities that, instead of seeking to improve academic performance, making a mess, get reduced amounts". The statement by former education minister Abraham Weintraub, to the newspaper O Estado de São Paulo, on April 30, 2019 caused an uproar in the academic world. Out of ignorance or bad faith, the minister accused Federal Universities of promoting “mess and ridiculous event” with public funds and, without mentioning indicators, of presenting “results below what was explored”.

Researchers, students, teachers and other education professionals have risen up in acceptable and started to publicize their experiences and contributions in the networks, raising a hashtag #MinhaPesquisaMinhaBalburdia, with countless reports of complete and remarkable studies for the scientific community and that benefit the whole society. Which, in turn, led to a wide dissemination of reports on news sites on the topic.

The present work was designed so that the user "undresses" this information with a simple gesture, through an interactive work using Kinect and Processing, taking into account the considerations of Julio Plaza (1990), in which the creation of art must always have as a fundamental question the correct idea of ​​“what is art for and what it is about”, taking into account the articulation of the various "spheres" that interact in the cultural dimension: "ideological sphere" and its systems of representations, values ​​and beliefs; a "cognitive sphere" and its scientific knowledge system; the "artistic sphere", understood "as a multifaceted and contradictory form of 'sensitive' appropriation of the real"; and the "technical sphere", in which the ways of proceeding from the various practices are verified) interact and recover.
